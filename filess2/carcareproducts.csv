Applying a coat of car wax or a synthetic paint sealant to your car’s finish offers 2 major benefits and some secondary benefits too.;Protects the paint, which protects your investment and makes the paint look good, which makes the car look good in turn.;;People can agree or disagree with these. The two primary benefits;I’ve listed are in fact the top primary benefits provided by applying a coat of car wax or a paint sealant to your car’s finish, but I think it’s pretty safe to say that the majority of car owners will wax their car for one of these two reasons and usually both. Besides those to major benefits, here are some spin-off benefits from the above.;Protecting the paint preserves the paint. In addition to that, applying a coat of wax or a paint sealant as a part of a regular maintenance program preserves the integrity of the paint, it keeps the paint in good condition. Regularly applying a coat of wax or paint sealant costs a lot less than having the car re-painted.;There is no such thing as a no-wax finish For decades Car Sales People have told potential customers that new cars come with clear coats and thus don’t need to be waxed. This is just down right ignorance;and dishonesty. New cars do come with clear coat finishes but the clear coat is still a type of paint that must be cared for, or it will deteriorate past the point of no return. Once your car’s paint goes past the point of no return the only option will be a new and costly paint job. Waxing the car preserves its;re-sale value. Regular waxing preserves the paint which in turn preserves the re-sale or trade-in value of the vehicle. When people make car buying decisions, the appearance quality of the car is a huge factor that influences their decision. A clean, shiny car creates the perception that the car is in overall excellent condition. A car that looks neglected on the outside will be perceived to be neglected in all areas. In conclusion, maintaining a coating of wax or paint sealant makes washing faster and easier. A uniform coating or layer of car wax or a paint sealant will help prevent most air-borne dirt and other contaminants from bonding to the paint thus they will wash off easier, this will make washing your car faster.

Formula 1 Carnauba Wash Wax – 16oz Protects the paint, which protects your investment2. Makes the paint look good, which makes the car look good People can agree or disagree with whether or not these two primary benefits I’ve listed are in fact the top primary benefits provided by applying a coat of car wax or a paint sealant to your car’s finish, but I think it’s pretty safe to say that the majority of car owners will wax their car for one of these two reasons and usually both. Besides those to major benefits, here are some spin-off benefits from the above… Protecting the paint preserves the paint Applying a coat of wax or a paint sealant as a part of a regular maintenance program preserves the integrity of the paint, it keeps the paint in good condition. Regularly applying a coat of wax or paint sealant cost a lot less than having the car re-painted. No such thing as a no-wax finish For decades Car Sales People have told potential customers that new cars come with clear coats and thus don’t need to be waxed. This is just down right ignorant and dishonest. New cars do come with clear coat finishes but the clear coat is still a type of paint that must be cared for or it will deteriorate past the point of no return. Once your car’s paint goes past the point of no return the only option will be a new and costly paint job. Preserves the resale value Regular waxing preserves the paint which in turn preserves the resale or trade-in value of the vehicle. When people make car buying decisions, the appearance quality of the car is a huge factor that influences their decision. A clean, shiny car creates the perception that the car is in overall excellent condition. A car that looks neglected on the outside will be perceived to be neglected in all areas. Maintaining a coating of wax or paint sealant makes washing faster and easier A uniform coating or layer of car wax or a paint sealant will help prevent most air-borne dirt and other contaminants from bonding to the paint thus they will wash off easier, this will make washing your car faster.

Polisher Buffer for Detailing - Mix Color | Car Polishing Machine | Grinder For heavy Duty Polishing Buy Maximus heavy duty polisher What buffing does and its benefits If you’ve never gotten your car detailed before, or even if you have, you may not be aware of what buffing is. Some people believe that it’s nothing more than another word for polishing. While it does share similarities, buffing actually refers to a process that removes a minute layer of a vehicle’s paint. Doing so has a number of advantages, such as: Fresh layer revealed — This is the primary effect of buffing your car. Under the layer of paint that has been exposed to the elements for years is a fresh layer just waiting to bust out. When done correctly and with the right type of compound, this can be a great way to make your vehicle look almost new again. Longer lasting finish — The best way to prolong the appearance of your vehicle is to take good care of it. Buffing is one way to do this. By treating its exterior with care, your car’s finish can last quite a bit longer. Removes minor scratches — No matter how careful you are, scratches to your vehicle’s clear coat are bound to happen. Buffing your car will often remove these blemishes, as long as they aren’t too deep. Three types of buffing techniques Buffing your car definitely has some great benefits. Once you decide to get it done, you’ll need to choose the way in which it’s handled. There are three types of techniques to choose from, each with their own pros and cons: Manual — If you enjoy taking a hands-on approach, you can do the buffing of your car manually. The best part is that it doesn’t take as much work on your part. Unfortunately, the results often aren’t even throughout your vehicle and they will end up being more temporary than other methods. High Speed — This is the best choice when it comes to buffing, but it must be done by a professional who has been well-trained in its use. If you do it yourself, you may end up damaging your vehicle. If your car has scratches that you’d like to have removed, a high-speed buffer is definitely the way to go. Orbital;— This is the middle ground of buffing your car. Orbital buffers can be used by non-professionals and don’t require as much compound to be effective, which will save you money and still get the job done.

Formula 1 Carnauba Liquid Car Wax 1. Protects the paint, which protects your investment2. Makes the paint look good, which makes the car look good People can agree or disagree with whether or not these two primary benefits I’ve listed are in fact the top primary benefits provided by applying a coat of car wax or a paint sealant to your car’s finish, but I think it’s pretty safe to say that the majority of car owners will wax their car for one of these two reasons and usually both. Besides those to major benefits, here are some spin-off benefits from the above… Protecting the paint preserves the paint Applying a coat of wax or a paint sealant as a part of a regular maintenance program preserves the integrity of the paint, it keeps the paint in good condition. Regularly applying a coat of wax or paint sealant cost a lot less than having the car re-painted. No such thing as a no-wax finish For decades Car Sales People have told potential customers that new cars come with clear coats and thus don’t need to be waxed. This is just down right ignorant and dishonest. New cars do come with clear coat finishes but the clear coat is still a type of paint that must be cared for or it will deteriorate past the point of no return. Once your car’s paint goes past the point of no return the only option will be a new and costly paint job. Preserves the re-sale value Regular waxing preserves the paint which in turn preserves the re-sale or trade-in value of the vehicle. When people make car buying decisions, the appearance quality of the car is a huge factor that influences their decision. A clean, shiny car creates the perception that the car is in overall excellent condition. A car that looks neglected on the outside will be perceived to be neglected in all areas. Maintaining a coating of wax or paint sealant makes washing faster and easier A uniform coating or layer of car wax or a paint sealant will help prevent most air-borne dirt and other contaminants from bonding to the paint thus they will wash off easier, this will make washing your car faster.

Protects the paint, which protects your investment 2. Makes the paint look good, which makes the car look good People can agree or disagree with whether or not these two primary benefits I’ve listed are in fact the top primary benefits provided by applying a coat of car wax or a paint sealant to your car’s finish, but I think it’s pretty safe to say that the majority of car owners will wax their car for one of these two reasons and usually both. Besides those to major benefits, here are some spin-off benefits from the above… Protecting the paint preserves the paint Applying a coat of wax or a paint sealant as a part of a regular maintenance program preserves the integrity of the paint, it keeps the paint in good condition. Regularly applying a coat of wax or paint sealant cost a lot less than having the car re-painted. No such thing as a no-wax finish For decades Car Sales People have told potential customers that new cars come with clear coats and thus don’t need to be waxed. This is just down right ignorant and dishonest. New cars do come with clear coat finishes but the clear coat is still a type of paint that must be cared for or it will deteriorate past the point of no return. Once your car’s paint goes past the point of no return the only option will be a new and costly paint job. Preserves the re-sale value Regular waxing preserves the paint which in turn preserves the re-sale or trade-in value of the vehicle. When people make car buying decisions, the appearance quality of the car is a huge factor that influences their decision. A clean, shiny car creates the perception that the car is in overall excellent condition. A car that looks neglected on the outside will be perceived to be neglected in all areas. Maintaining a coating of wax or paint sealant makes washing faster and easier A uniform coating or layer of car wax or a paint sealant will help prevent most air-borne dirt and other contaminants from bonding to the paint thus they will wash off easier, this will make washing your car faster. ; ; ","carcareproducts","-",2500.0,500,"[""https://sehgalmotors.pk/cdn/shop/files/1699967784006207.jpg?v=1713804902"", ""https://sehgalmotors.pk/cdn/shop/files/1713526237006207.jpg?v=1713804902"", ""https://sehgalmotors.pk/cdn/shop/files/636441224410980959-Turtle-Wax-Luxe.jpgnewop.jpg?v=1713804902""]","[""-""]","-","exterior",0,0,0

Foam Application: Dilute the snow foam as per the recommended ratio and apply it using a foam cannon or a pressure washer. The thick foam should be sprayed evenly across the vehicle's surface, ensuring complete coverage.

Dwell Time: Allow the foam to dwell on the surface for a few minutes, letting its extreme clinging action encapsulate and dissolve dirt. The extended dwell time enhances the cleaning efficiency, making it easier to rinse away contaminants.

No such thing as a no-wax finish For decades Car Sales People have told potential customers that new cars come with clear coats and thus don’t need to be waxed. This is just down right ignorant and dishonest. New cars do come with clear coat finishes but the clear coat is still a type of paint that must be cared for or it will deteriorate past the point of no return. Once your car’s paint goes past the point of no return the only option will be a new and costly paint job. Preserves the re-sale value Regular waxing preserves the paint which in turn preserves the re-sale or trade-in value of the vehicle. When people make car buying decisions, the appearance quality of the car is a huge factor that influences their decision. A clean, shiny car creates the perception that the car is in overall excellent condition. A car that looks neglected on the outside will be perceived to be neglected in all areas. Maintaining a coating of wax or paint sealant makes washing faster and easier A uniform coating or layer of car wax or a paint sealant will help prevent most air-borne dirt and other contaminants from bonding to the paint thus they will wash off easier, this will make washing your car faster.

Formula 1 Metallic Car Polish – 16 oz. 1. Protects the paint, which protects your investment2. Makes the paint look good, which makes the car look good People can agree or disagree with whether or not these two primary benefits I’ve listed are in fact the top primary benefits provided by applying a coat of car wax or a paint sealant to your car’s finish, but I think it’s pretty safe to say that the majority of car owners will wax their car for one of these two reasons and usually both. Besides those to major benefits, here are some spin-off benefits from the above… Protecting the paint preserves the paint Applying a coat of wax or a paint sealant as a part of a regular maintenance program preserves the integrity of the paint, it keeps the paint in good condition. Regularly applying a coat of wax or paint sealant cost a lot less than having the car re-painted. No such thing as a no-wax finish For decades Car Sales People have told potential customers that new cars come with clear coats and thus don’t need to be waxed. This is just down right ignorant and dishonest. New cars do come with clear coat finishes but the clear coat is still a type of paint that must be cared for or it will deteriorate past the point of no return. Once your car’s paint goes past the point of no return the only option will be a new and costly paint job. Preserves the re-sale value Regular waxing preserves the paint which in turn preserves the re-sale or trade-in value of the vehicle. When people make car buying decisions, the appearance quality of the car is a huge factor that influences their decision.

Mothers Protectant Rubber Vinyl Plastic – 16oz 1. Protects the paint, which protects your investment 2. Makes the paint look good, which makes the car look good People can agree or disagree with whether or not these two primary benefits I’ve listed are in fact the top primary benefits provided by applying a coat of car wax or a paint sealant to your car’s finish, but I think it’s pretty safe to say that the majority of car owners will wax their car for one of these two reasons and usually both. Besides those to major benefits, here are some spin-off benefits from the above… Protecting the paint preserves the paint Applying a coat of wax or a paint sealant as a part of a regular maintenance program preserves the integrity of the paint, it keeps the paint in good condition. Regularly applying a coat of wax or paint sealant cost a lot less than having the car re-painted. No such thing as a no-wax finish For decades Car Sales People have told potential customers that new cars come with clear coats and thus don’t need to be waxed. This is just down right ignorant and dishonest. New cars do come with clear coat finishes but the clear coat is still a type of paint that must be cared for or it will deteriorate past the point of no return. Once your car’s paint goes past the point of no return the only option will be a new and costly paint job. Preserves the re-sale value Regular waxing preserves the paint which in turn preserves the re-sale or trade-in value of the vehicle. When people make car buying decisions, the appearance quality of the car is a huge factor that influences their decision. A clean, shiny car creates the perception that the car is in overall excellent condition. A car that looks neglected on the outside will be perceived to be neglected in all areas. Maintaining a coating of wax or paint sealant makes washing faster and easier A uniform coating or layer of car wax or a paint sealant will help prevent most air-borne dirt and other contaminants from bonding to the paint thus they will wash off easier, this will make washing your car faster.

AIM Chamois Cleaner Cloth Strong absorption ability. Soft touch,don’t scratch your car or other items. Strong tenacity, tear resistance. Environmental protection PVA material, it becomes hard when dried to prevent the invasion and reproduction. Product Specification Material explanation: The preparation method of the suede is usually made of sheepskin, beacuse muntjac is one second class protected animal in the country, the number is rare so forbidding the killing, so now the formal manufacturers are using sheep skins to make. The clean leather is made of oil tanning method, soft and has good protection for the easy to scratch glass. Benefits of Microfiber Technology for Your Facility ;Time-Effective and Efficient. Microfiber mops, dusters, and cloths are light and ergonomic. This significantly diminishes the amount of time needed for particular cleaning tasks. A microfiber mop, for example, weighs roughly 5 lbs less than a string mop. It reduces the strain from heavy lift and twisting, and eliminates many of the time-consuming tasks associated with mopping (moving and dumping buckets, wringing out the mop, repeated fillings, etc.). Being lighter, they are also faster to maneuver. One custodial company found that using flat microfiber mops led to an 18% increase in productivity. Environmentally Friendly and Reduces Chemical Usage. Using microfiber products allows for chemical-free cleaning. The split cross-sections in microfiber that catch dirt and other particles leave surfaces free of unwanted materials without necessitating chemicals. They can clean nearly any surface with only water. Regular cloths do not trap particles in this way and need chemicals to assist in the cleaning process. The chemicals are harmful in the long term to the people in the building, as well as to the environment. Preserves Surfaces. Using microfiber helps preserve interior finishes. Quality microfiber products will not scratch delicate surfaces, as long as they are well-rinsed and free of grit. Since microfiber picks up debris rather than pushing it, particles do not have the opportunity to leave scratches. This is why microfiber cloths are recommended for vehicle exteriors and eyeglasses. Increases Cleanliness and Hygiene. Microfiber products provide a superior level of hygiene and cleanliness. Used in hospitals and recommended by the Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology, microfiber is able to remove 99% of bacteria while traditional products only remove 30%. Microfiber products eliminate germs, which prevents the people in your building from becoming ill. As the fibers rub together, microfiber creates a static charge. This increases its ability to clean – the charge helps to attract dirt into the crevices in the strands. Because of this, microfiber products have become known as “dirt magnets” ; ","carcareproducts","-",857.0,500,"[""https://sehgalmotors.pk/cdn/shop/files/Maximus-Chamois-Cleaner-Cloth-Small-MFC-19-Multi-Super-Absorbent-Microfiber-Synthetic-Chamois-Clean-Towel-SehgalMotors-pk-5533.jpg?v=1707913401"", ""https://sehgalmotors.pk/cdn/shop/files/Maximus-Chamois-Cleaner-Cloth-Small-MFC-19-Multi-Super-Absorbent-Microfiber-Synthetic-Chamois-Clean-Towel-SehgalMotors-pk-6491.jpg?v=1707913404"", ""https://sehgalmotors.pk/cdn/shop/files/Maximus-Chamois-Cleaner-Cloth-Small-MFC-19-Multi-Super-Absorbent-Microfiber-Synthetic-Chamois-Clean-Towel-SehgalMotors-pk-2470.jpg?v=1707913407"", ""https://sehgalmotors.pk/cdn/shop/files/Maximus-Chamois-Cleaner-Cloth-Small-MFC-19-Multi-Super-Absorbent-Microfiber-Synthetic-Chamois-Clean-Towel-SehgalMotors-pk-3003.jpg?v=1707913411""]","[""-""]","-","interior",0,0,0

Protects the paint, which protects your investment 2. Makes the paint look good, which makes the car look good People can agree or disagree with whether or not these two primary benefits I’ve listed are in fact the top primary benefits provided by applying a coat of car wax or a paint sealant to your car’s finish, but I think it’s pretty safe to say that the majority of car owners will wax their car for one of these two reasons and usually both. Besides those to major benefits, here are some spin-off benefits from the above… Protecting the paint preserves the paint Applying a coat of wax or a paint sealant as a part of a regular maintenance program preserves the integrity of the paint, it keeps the paint in good condition. Regularly applying a coat of wax or paint sealant cost a lot less than having the car re-painted. No such thing as a no-wax finish For decades Car Sales People have told potential customers that new cars come with clear coats and thus don’t need to be waxed. This is just down right ignorant and dishonest. New cars do come with clear coat finishes but the clear coat is still a type of paint that must be cared for or it will deteriorate past the point of no return. Once your car’s paint goes past the point of no return the only option will be a new and costly paint job. Preserves the re-sale value Regular waxing preserves the paint which in turn preserves the re-sale or trade-in value of the vehicle. When people make car buying decisions, the appearance quality of the car is a huge factor that influences their decision. A clean, shiny car creates the perception that the car is in overall excellent condition. A car that looks neglected on the outside will be perceived to be neglected in all areas. Maintaining a coating of wax or paint sealant makes washing faster and easier A uniform coating or layer of car wax or a paint sealant will help prevent most air-borne dirt and other contaminants from bonding to the paint thus they will wash off easier, this will make washing your car faster. ; ; ","carcareproducts","-",1500.0,500,"[""https://sehgalmotors.pk/cdn/shop/files/1698755082SKU_20_20006225.jpg?v=1713804889"", ""https://sehgalmotors.pk/cdn/shop/files/637741313942981190.jpgnewop.jpg?v=1713804889""]","[""-""]","-","exterior",0,0,0
