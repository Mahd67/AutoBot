It’s a fairly simple car with not many frills. But its tiny size and rugged ability make it a fantastic car for off-roading. First introduced in 1970, this little SUV is now in its fourth generation . The first generation Suzuki Jimny was called the LJ10 (Light Jeep 10). It came with a 359cc air-cooled in-line two-cylinder engine with a 4-speed manual transmission. In 1972, Suzuki introduced the LJ20 model with a water-cooled engine. The second generation Suzuki Jimny came in 1981 with a 539cc three-cylinder engine. Later, the same model came with bigger 970cc and 1328cc engines with 5-speed manual transmission. The third generation Suzuki Jimny arrived in 1998 and continued till 2018. During these years, the car was offered in four different engine sizes — 658cc, 1298cc, 1328cc, and 1461cc. The third-gen came with a 5-speed manual and 4-speed automatic transmission options. The latest fourth generation Jimny was introduced in 2018 with a 1.5L engine with a 5-speed manual and 4-speed automatic transmission options. Other than engine and gearbox, nothing more has changed in the Suzuki Jimny. All four generations have the same boxy looks. Although the fourth generation took over the third generation three years ago, the third generation Jimny is more popular than the fourth one. Exterior The latest fourth generation Suzuki Jimny has the same retro look as the previous generations but with a few styling cues from other off-roaders. Although the current Jimny weighs almost twice as much as the first one, it still looks a bit like a baby Jeep. New Jimny’s squared-off design gives it a tougher look than its predecessor, but the grille and round headlights borrow heavily from the first-gen Jimny. Chunky 15-inch all-season tires add to its off-roading capabilities. Interior The interior of Suzuki Jimny is pretty basic, but it does bring a host of feel-good features. The neat leather-wrapped multi-function steering wheel is height adjustable. The front is surprisingly roomy, but the back seats are cramped. There are no rear doors and climbing into the second row is a hassle. The rear windows are fixed and can’t be opened. There are no air vents, so it can feel claustrophobic on long trips. Engine The latest Jimny model is powered with a naturally aspirated 1.5-liter inline-four good for 101 horsepower and 130 Nm of torque. Mileage When the 1.5L engine is mated to the 5-speed manual gearbox, the car gives a mileage of 15 to 16 kilometers per liter. With a 4-speed automatic transmission, the fuel economy comes to 13 to 14 km/L. Competitors In the international market, Suzuki’s tiny off-roading SUV competes with Mazda CX-3, Honda HR-V, and Ford EcoSport.

Toyota Rush Exterior The new Toyota Rush 2024 has a sharp and distinctive front fascia with a unique headlight cluster design that features LED headlamps with silver ornaments and houses front fog and driving lamps with chrome bezel. The front also sports LED daytime running lights . The bold chrome grille on the front gives it a dominating look. The rear of the Rush 2024 comes with sleek horizontal styled rear LED combination lamps . The rear also sports a high-mount stop lamp and a rear spoiler. The top of the car sports roof rails to increase boot space by adding a roof rack. Toyota Rush Interior The interior of the new Toyota Rush 2024 is not too spacious. The legroom for front passengers and third-row passengers is cramped. Moreover, the material used in the interior of the car is of average quality, making the car not too attractive. The urethane-wrapped steering wheel comes with steering switches for audio control. Behind the steering wheel is an LCD multi-information display with chrome rings. The Toyota Rush 2024 sports push-start feature. It features dual-zone automatic air-conditioning with a rear cooler as well as a heating system. The car also comes with a rear window defogger, rear center console, power windows, and clearance back sonar . The power outlets are only available in the front of the car. The fabric-wrapped seats come with headrests but only the driver seat is vertically adjustable. The center fascia houses a 7-inch capacitative touchscreen that supports DVD, USB, MP3, Bluetooth, Wifi, Android Auto, and Apple CarPlay. Toyota Rush Safety The Toyota Rush 2024 comes with some of the modern safety features such as an immobilizer with a safety alarm for the anti-theft system. In addition to that, it also has an anti-lock braking system, vehicle stability control , emergency signal system, and hill-start assist control . Toyota Rush 2024 also comes equipped with brake warning , fuel level warning, door ajar warning, light reminder warning, and key reminder warning systems.

Toyota Rush Engine The new Toyota Rush 2024 comes with a 1.5 Liter DOHC 16 Valve Inline-4 engine that can generate a maximum output of 77/6000 kW/rpm at a maximum torque of 136/4200 Nm/rpm. The Toyota Rush G M/T variant comes with 5-speed manual transmission and the Toyota Rush G A/T variant comes with 4-speed automatic transmission . Toyota Rush Ride & Handling The new Toyota Rush 2024 is an easy-to-handle car . It allows complete control over the car to the driver and is safe for the daily commute and family trips. A downside of the Toyota Rush 2024 is that its acceleration is dull and underpowered. Its performance at high speeds does not match other cars by Toyota. Toyota Rush 2024 is not meant for thrilling adventures and is most suited to be driven within the city. Moreover, its hill-assent feature is not up to the mark, making its performance quite average. Toyota Rush Maintenance The maintenance of the Toyota Rush 2024 is quite expensive . The car itself is expensive and so are its auto parts. Its auto parts are not widely available throughout Pakistan which makes maintenance even more difficult. Toyota Rush Competitors The new Toyota Rush 2024 competes with Honda Vezel, Kia Sportage, and Hyundai Tucson in the Pakistani automobile market. Although Honda Vezel is a five-seater car, it sports a similar engine as that of the Rush 2024. Vezel beats Rush when it comes to better engine performance and overall ride quality. Vezel also comes with cruise control, an essential feature that Toyota Rush lacks. On the other hand, Rush 2024 provides a larger seating capacity, better fuel economy, and better safety options. Kia Sportage is a strong rival of Toyota Rush 2024 as it is cheaper in comparison and provides countless more safety and driver-assist features. The Sportage comes with a 2.0-liter petrol engine which gives a better performance, better mileage, larger dimensions, and is jam-packed with features. Rush, in comparison, only provides more seating capacity. Hyundai Tucson also competes with Toyota Rush 2024 and beats it due to its good fuel economy, better on-road performance, and several driver-assist features.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,,Yes,Yes,,Yes,,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,,Yes,,Yes,,Yes,,Yes,,,Yes,Yes,,,Yes,,,,,,,,Yes,Yes,Yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The second-generation Hilux was launched in 1972 with a more comfortable interior and improved exterior. The pick-up was received well globally and came with options in transmission and engines. The third-generation Hilux was introduced in 1978 which had a 4WD variant. The new Hilux was redesigned with wider front and rear base and had new suspensions. The 4WD variant was only available with engines of 2 liters and more. The fourth-generation Hilux was launched in 1983 with an improvement in design. The pick-up came with an option of 6 inches of extra in-cabin space. It later received a facelift with minor external improvements such as addition of a front bumper and a new grille. The fifth generation debuted in 1988 and had minor improvements. The only noticeable difference was a larger wheelbase.

These generations had modern design with better technology. The name “Revo” was introduced for the eighth generation in 2015. It came with the trim Hilux Revo Rocco which had different front design and different fog lamps. It further received a facelift in 2020 with minor external and internal improvements and added safety features. Toyota Hilux is also known for its commercial use around the world. It is also usd by the Pakistan Police Force for patrolling services. Toyota Hilux Exterior With a bold yet sharp exterior, the Toyota Hilux 2024 has a dominating presence. The front is embellished by a bold trapezoid grille coupled with Hi-grade bi-beam LED halogen lamps . Below these headlamps lie LED fog lamps. The rear houses LED rear combination lamps. The rear also has a high-mounted LED stop lamp . Toyota Hilux Interior The new Toyota Hilux 2024 supports smart entry into the all black cabin . Common features of all the trims of Hilux double cabin include air conditioner, heater, side defogger, adjustable headrests, steering controls and infotainment system. Only the Hilux E lacks air conditioning, steering controls, and an infotainment system. Except the Hilux E, the rest of the trims of the double cabin have power door lock with speed, jack-knife wireless key, power windows, window wipers with mist, illuminated entry system, and 12V DC accessory connector. Hilux 4x4 is the only single cabin trim with manual air conditioning while the rest lack air conditioning all together.

The manual transmission is more responsive than the automatic transmission but takes more time to reach maximum speed. Overall, Toyota Hilux 2024 provides a comfortable ride but requires some expertise for handling as it is a pick-up.

The single cabin trims include Hilux deckless which comes with 2393 cc diesel engine, the Hilux 4x2 Petrol which comes with 2694 cc petrol engine, the Hilux 4x2 and Hilux 4x2 UPSPEC which come with 2393 cc diesel engine, and the Hilux 4x4 which comes with 2755 cc diesel engine.

Toyota Hilux Mileage With a fuel tank of 80 liters , all the Hilux trims have a fuel economy of 9 km/l in the city and 11 km/l on the highway. Hilux Ride & Handling 2024 Toyota Hilux is known for its strength and off-roading capabilities . The new Hilux 2024 is even better when it comes to going on off-road adventures. Its stiff suspension and strong engine make it superior to its competitors and it delivers a quality ride. The stiff suspension might be bothersome in routine drives but that is what allows the Hilux to bear heavy weights. The manual transmission is more responsive than the automatic transmission but takes more time to reach maximum speed. Overall, Toyota Hilux 2024 provides a comfortable ride but requires some expertise for handling as it is a pick-up. Hilux Maintenance As Toyota Hilux is locally assembled, its parts are easily available in Pakistan. The downside is that its auto parts are expensive which might make maintenance difficult. Hilux Specs In Pakistan, Toyota replaced the 2.8L engine in 2021, now Toyota Hilux Revo 2024 comes with 2.8L Turbocharged 1GD-FTV engine.

With sufficient ground clearance and an impressive power-to-weight ratio, the Fortuner becomes an ideal companion for off-road adventures.Thanks to its Active traction control system, the Fortuner maintains a strong grip and can deliver maximum torque when needed. However, despite its off-road prowess, the car's ride quality falls short in certain aspects. It struggles to effectively absorb shocks, leading to a somewhat poor ride experience. Driving over potholes can result in a jerky and uncomfortable ride for occupants, which may be a drawback for those seeking a smoother journey. Toyota Fortuner Maintenance Like the other Toyota vehicles, Fortuner 2024 is also not so high maintenance. The company provides a minimum of 3 year warranty and Fortuner’s auto parts are also easily available making its maintenance more convenient.

It was launched in 1982 and has gone through multiple generations. After Corolla, Camry has enjoyed worldwide success and has a loyal consumer base. From 1979 to 1982, Camry came as a narrow body vehicle and was called Celica Camry. At the time, it was a compact four-door sedan and was offered only with rear-wheel-drive and front-engine configuration. On top of that, it came with a 5-speed manual and 4-speed automatic transmission. Engines included 1.5L, 1.8L, and 2.0L variants. Currently, Camry competes fiercely with Honda Accord across the globe. Camry V10 to V50 came with narrow body shapes. These generations were launched in 1982, and their production ended in 2003. In 1986, a station wagon variant was added. In 1990, this variant was discontinued due to poor sales performance. In this era, only four-cylinder engines were offered. Even in older generations, Toyota Camry came equipped with a lot of standard equipment. These included power steering, power windows, power mirrors, adjustable steering, and rear folding armrest. After these generations, a wide-body style was introduced, and the Camry was cast as a mid-sized sedan. Camry XV10 to XV70 were referred to as wide-body sedans and were launched in 1991. A V6 petrol engine was introduced in 1996, and it has since been offered in the Camry lineup. Two trim levels were raised, and these were regular, and Prestige trims. These wide-body models were manufactured on the Toyota K platform. This platform is very strong and lights at the same time. The current model is based on the Toyota New Global Architect. The newer models are also equipped with an optional all-wheel-drive system. These can also be equipped with a hybrid powertrain. Notable features in the current Camry 2024, which was launched initially in 2017, include direct-shift 8-speed automatic transmission, metallic front grille, dual exhausts with chrome surrounds, 19-inch alloy rims, and LED taillights. There are three driving modes and include Normal, Eco, and Sport. There is a sport variant called the TRD trim. This trim has a V6 engine that produces 301 bhp. This is the same engine that comes in other higher trim levels of the Camry. Therefore, a new engine was not developed for the TRD variant. Only exterior and interior design changes were made. The TRD variant has red brake calipers, cat-back dual exhaust, black seats and other trim pieces and red stitching to highlight the sporty nature of the sedan. A 9-inch multimedia screen is provided in the Camry that can be used to carry out various functions. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are provided to pair your mobile phone effectively with the infotainment system. Smart key and push-start buttons make it very easy to get in and drive away in your car. In Pakistan, the Toyota Camry 2024 is available in 2 trims - low-grade trim and high-grade trim.

Initially, it was a 3-door hatchback/2-door convertible launched only in selected markets. The second-generation Honda City was launched in 1986, but the City nameplate was discontinued in 1994 and replaced by another model. The Honda City was reintroduced in 1996 as a series of subcompact four-door sedans. This third-generation City was built on Honda's Global Small Car platform in which the location of the fuel tank is under the front seats rather than rear seats. The third generation of Honda City gained its name among the consumers as it hit back the sales of Suzuki Margalla in its early days. The company also introduced a facelift version of the third-gen Honda City in 2000 and continued its production for another three years before introducing the next generation in Pakistan. The fourth-generation Honda City was launched globally in 2002 and later received a facelift in 2005. Honda City was reintroduced in the Pakistani market when Honda introduced the fourth generation of the popular compact sedan in 2003. The level of fuel economy was brought to another level with the introduction of the twin-spark i-DSI engine-based City. It became immensely popular in the local market and is still considered as one of the most fuel-efficient cars in its league. Owing to its popularity, the company also launched a facelift version in 2005 which continued till 2008. Some major changes were made in the exterior of the car while slight changes in the interior were also observed. It is worth mentioning here that the steermatic version of the third generation did not go too well in the local auto market. The fifth generation of Honda City Pakistan was launched back in 2009, and since then, we have seen many facelift versions of the car. The company is yet to give up on this particular model, and it has passed a decade of production. The popularity of Honda’s compact sedan still prevails owing to its fuel economy and smooth drive, although there are still no airbags at any trim level. It is available in 1.3L and 1.5L variants in the country. Since 2009, it has received plenty of cosmetic changes, including the new design of the front radiator grille, headlights, and tail lights. The sixth generation City debuted in the international market in 2014 and was replaced by the next seventh generation last year, in 2020, but arrived in Pakistan in 2021. Honda City Exterior The new Honda City has a bold design. Its front is embellished with a honeycomb grille which gives it a striking appearance. Premium dual-barrel halogen headlamps and integrated LED daytime running lights (DRLs) adorn the front of all five variants. The 1.5 Aspire variants come with front fog lights while it is an option in the rest of the variants. A micropole antenna is available in the 1.2 LS variants and a shark fin antenna is available in the rest of the variants. Advanced wrap-around bulb rear lights are a standard in all the variants. Honda City Interior The Honda City is a spacious sedan that comes with a comfortable interior. Available with the push-button start technology in the Aspire variants, the new Honda City has a hi-grade fabric wrapped steering wheel which can be adjusted in tilt as well as telescopic adjustment. The seats, armrests, and door linings materials also vary in different variants. In the 1.2 LS variants and 1.5 CVT variant, the interior is wrapped in fabric while the 1.5 Aspire variants have the interior wrapped in hi-grade fabric. ECON mode is only available in the 1.5L CVT and 1.5L Aspire CVT variant while dust and pollen air filter, steering audio switches, one-touch lane indicator, digital clock, and outside temp display are available in all five variants. The seats are comfortable and the whole interior comes in ivory color. The driver’s seat height can be adjusted in all the variants and impact mitigating headrests are also available in all the variants. The Honda City 1.2 LS variants and the 1.5 CVT variant have a 7-inch capacitive touchscreen which has integrated MP%, BlueTooth, mic, rear camera ready, radio, mirror link for android as well as USB and AUX cable support. On the other hand, the 1.5 Aspire variants have a 9-inch android based capacitive touchscreen including navigation, built-in sim slot, Wi-fi, and smartphone easy connect along with other features. The 1.2 LS and 1.5 CVT variants have 2 speakers in the front while the Aspire variants have 4 speakers with 2 in the front and 2 in the rear area.

Anti-lock braking system (ABS) and electronic brake distribution (EBD) are standard features in all five variants. Honda City Engine All five variants of the new Honda City come with the water-cooled, 4-stroke, SOHC i-VTEC, 16-valves, four-cylinder engine. The 1.2 LS variants have a 1199cc engine which generates a power of 88/6000 hp/rpm at a torque of 110/4800 Nm/rpm. On the other hand, the 1.5 CVT and 1.5 Aspire variants have a 1497cc engine which generates a power of 118/6600 hp/rpm at a max torque of 145/4600 Nm/rpm. Honda City Mileage The Honda City 2024 offers impressive fuel economy across all five variants. The mileage ranges from 17.8 km/l to 24.1 km/l , depending on the variant and driving conditions. The fuel tank capacity is 40 liters . Honda City Ride & handling The Honda City 2024 provides a smooth driving experience with a 6-speed gearbox and comfortable handling in city traffic. The engine performance is efficient with minimal turbo lag, however, it may start to shiver above 4000rpm. One major drawback is the lack of vehicle stability control which puts it at a disadvantage compared to its competitors.

Initially, it was a 3-door hatchback/2-door convertible launched only in selected markets. The second-generation Honda City was launched in 1986, but the City nameplate was discontinued in 1994 and replaced by another model. The Honda City was reintroduced in 1996 as a series of subcompact four-door sedans. This third-generation City was built on Honda's Global Small Car platform in which the location of the fuel tank is under the front seats rather than rear seats. The third generation of Honda City gained its name among the consumers as it hit back the sales of Suzuki Margalla in its early days. The company also introduced a facelift version of the third-gen Honda City in 2000 and continued its production for another three years before introducing the next generation in Pakistan. The fourth-generation Honda City was launched globally in 2002 and later received a facelift in 2005. Honda City was reintroduced in the Pakistani market when Honda introduced the fourth generation of the popular compact sedan in 2003. The level of fuel economy was brought to another level with the introduction of the twin-spark i-DSI engine-based City. It became immensely popular in the local market and is still considered as one of the most fuel-efficient cars in its league. Owing to its popularity, the company also launched a facelift version in 2005 which continued till 2008. Some major changes were made in the exterior of the car while slight changes in the interior were also observed.

Initially, it was a 3-door hatchback/2-door convertible launched only in selected markets. The second-generation Honda City was launched in 1986, but the City nameplate was discontinued in 1994 and replaced by another model. The Honda City was reintroduced in 1996 as a series of subcompact four-door sedans. This third-generation City was built on Honda's Global Small Car platform in which the location of the fuel tank is under the front seats rather than rear seats. The third generation of Honda City gained its name among the consumers as it hit back the sales of Suzuki Margalla in its early days. The company also introduced a facelift version of the third-gen Honda City in 2000 and continued its production for another three years before introducing the next generation in Pakistan. The fourth-generation Honda City was launched globally in 2002 and later received a facelift in 2005. Honda City was reintroduced in the Pakistani market when Honda introduced the fourth generation of the popular compact sedan in 2003. The level of fuel economy was brought to another level with the introduction of the twin-spark i-DSI engine-based City. It became immensely popular in the local market and is still considered as one of the most fuel-efficient cars in its league. Owing to its popularity, the company also launched a facelift version in 2005 which continued till 2008. Some major changes were made in the exterior of the car while slight changes in the interior were also observed. It is worth mentioning here that the steermatic version of the third generation did not go too well in the local auto market. The fifth generation of Honda City Pakistan was launched back in 2009, and since then, we have seen many facelift versions of the car. The company is yet to give up on this particular model, and it has passed a decade of production. The popularity of Honda’s compact sedan still prevails owing to its fuel economy and smooth drive, although there are still no airbags at any trim level. It is available in 1.3L and 1.5L variants in the country. Since 2009, it has received plenty of cosmetic changes, including the new design of the front radiator grille, headlights, and tail lights. The sixth generation City debuted in the international market in 2014 and was replaced by the next seventh generation last year, in 2020, but arrived in Pakistan in 2021. Honda City Exterior The new Honda City has a bold design. Its front is embellished with a honeycomb grille which gives it a striking appearance. Premium dual-barrel halogen headlamps and integrated LED daytime running lights (DRLs) adorn the front of all five variants.

A micropole antenna is available in the 1.2 LS variants and a shark fin antenna is available in the rest of the variants. Advanced wrap-around bulb rear lights are a standard in all the variants. Honda City Interior The Honda City is a spacious sedan that comes with a comfortable interior. Available with the push-button start technology in the Aspire variants, the new Honda City has a hi-grade fabric wrapped steering wheel which can be adjusted in tilt as well as telescopic adjustment. The seats, armrests, and door linings materials also vary in different variants. In the 1.2 LS variants and 1.5 CVT variant, the interior is wrapped in fabric while the 1.5 Aspire variants have the interior wrapped in hi-grade fabric. ECON mode is only available in the 1.5L CVT and 1.5L Aspire CVT variant while dust and pollen air filter, steering audio switches, one-touch lane indicator, digital clock, and outside temp display are available in all five variants. The seats are comfortable and the whole interior comes in ivory color.

The sedan version of the Accord has been a long-standing best-selling vehicle in many regions across the globe. The biggest competition comes from Toyota Camry. The Accord name has been used on many different body styles. These include coupes, wagons, crossovers,, and hatchbacks. In the United States, the Accord has enjoyed a lot of success, and it became one of the first few Japanese cars to get assembled in the country. This is because the Accord provides an ample amount of legroom and headroom for rear passengers. The boot space is sizable, and the drive is comfortable in urban areas. The first generation was launched in 1976 as a hatchback. It remained in production till 1981. At a later date, a sedan version was introduced. During the first generation, the Accord was classified as a compact sedan/hatchback. Two different engine options were provided, and these included 1.6L and 1.8L. These engines were paired with either a 3-speed automatic or 5-speed manual transmission. Standard equipment included AM/FM radio, cloth seats, intermittent wipers, and tachometer. The second generation was launched in 1981 and remained in production till 1985. It was still available in both hatchback and sedan body configurations. Five different engine choices were given with three different transmission options. Both automatic and manual transmissions were available for this generation. Notable features included a sunroof, leather seats (upper trim levels only), power windows, and power locks. Headlamp washers were also included in some regions. The third generation was launched in 1985 and continued till 1989. Four body styles were available in this generation: sedan, coupe, hatchback, and shooting break. Eight powertrains were available, but they were very similar. These engines were either paired with a 4-speed automatic or 5-speed manual transmission. The shooting-break variant was the highlight of this generation. This variant was named AeroDeck. The fourth-generation was in production from 1989 to 1993. The shooting-break model was discontinued, and only three body styles were available. These included sedan, coupe, and station wagon. Notable features included power steering, power windows, power locks, CD player, center armrest, fog lights, and a security system. The fifth-generation was in production from 1993 to 1997. The Acura brand was launched under the umbrella of Honda, and it started selling premium versions of Accord. Engine and transmission options were similar to those of the third generation. However, the sales of the Accord were never eroded by Acura models. Honda products have always been cheaper than Acura products. From the sixth to the tenth generation, Accord has grown in size. This can be seen in the increased length and width of the car. The seventh-generation was very popular in Pakistan and the rest of the world. This was the time when Accord rose to prominence. Accord models have been rated high on safety ratings across the globe. Eighth generations introduced a lot of new features. These included airbags, rearview camera, and alloy rims. The current and the tenth generation is a high-tech machine. It includes features like a heads-up display (6-inch), lumbar support, PVB laminated windows, power seats, and a Honda Sensing package for different driver aids. The coupe variant has been discontinued, and only the sedan is available for sale. Honda Accord has been a popular vehicle in Pakistan. However, over the past few years, its numbers have diminished. This is due to the entry of competitors in the market and the fact that Accord is not produced locally. Therefore, it is very expensive to buy and then maintain. Currently, Pakistan has the 10th generation Honda Accord. Honda Accord Exterior The new Honda Accord 2024 comes in an elegant style and sleek design. The new design language shares similarities with the previous one and retains the uniqueness of Accord. The front houses a sleek and thin front grille paired with LED low-beam headlights and LED fog lights.

Suzuki has kind of a monopoly when it comes to Pakistan’s hatchback market. The company has a strong goodwill in the country and a well-established consumer base. That is why, Picanto faces extreme competition with Suzuki’s most affordable and value-for-money vehicle - Cultus. Cultus has a slightly more spacious interior and is more fuel efficient than the Picanto. On the other hand, Picanto beats Cultus when it comes to modern features such as airbags, IsoFix, ABS, etc. On the downside, Picanto is more expensive than Cultus. With almost the same specifications, Wagon-R competes with Picanto for its position in the market as an affordable hatchback. The Wagon-R is a lot cheaper than the Picanto, with a lot more interior space. On the other hand, Picanto is a feature-packed car with a lot more comfort.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,,Yes,,,Yes,Yes,,Yes,,,Yes,Yes,,Yes,,,,,Yes,,,Yes,,,,,,Yes,,,,,,,,,Yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was first introduced in South Korea in 2017 and later got a face-lift in October 2020. It was discontinued in South Korea in 2020 due to its lack of popularity. But now, the new, face-lifted model is launched in Pakistan on 8th November 2021 . As per KIA, STONIC is derived from the words SPEEDY and TONIC, the first and last notes on a musical scale. On the KIA model portfolio, Stonic is the smallest KIA crossover that sits two steps down under Sportage. The company advertises KIA Stonic as a small car for big adventures, indicating that it is suitable for both intra-city tours and long drives. This car is being locally assembled in Pakistan by KIA Lucky Motors. The Completely Knocked Down (CKD) units of KIA Stonic are ready for shipment to dealerships for displays and test drives. This means that its spare parts will also be easily available in the market. Kia Stonic Exterior The sleek yet bold design of the KIA Stonic 2024 sets it apart from its competitors. KIA’s signature tiger-nose grille and muscular bumpers add to its boldness. The Stonic EX comes with a matte black grille while the EX+ comes with one in piano black. It has LED daytime running lights in all of its variants but the front and rear fog lights are only available in the usual bulb in both variants.The outside mirror in both KIA Stonic EX and EX+ is electrically adjustable, retractable, and heated. The EX+ also comes with a rearview mirror.The KIA Stonic EX comes with bi-function halogen projection headlamps with static bending light which light up the corners of the road while taking turns at slow speeds. On the other hand, the EX+ has LED projection headlamps. The rear of the Stonic 2024 is no less spectacular with three-dimensional combination lamps and a steep rear window. A purposeful spoiler caps the rear window which houses a high-mounted brake light. The KIA Stonic EX+ also comes with a sunroof which the EX model lacks. The aerodynamic design of all Stonic 2024 variants directs airflow towards the engine and wheel wells for better stability at high speeds. The EX comes with 15-inch alloy rims and the EX+ comes with 16-inch alloy rims . Kia Stonic Interior The interior of the KIA Stonic 2024 is clean and comfortable. The company claims to have a seating capacity of 5 but practically it is limited to only 4. All of the seats have adjustable headrests and both variants come with 6 airbags. The rear seats have the feature of a 40:60 split-fold to increase storage space. The D-shaped steering wheel creates convenience and more legroom for the driver but it is only available in KIA Stonic EX+. Options like audio call, voice recognition, and mid software changes are available at the driver’s fingertips as they are part of steering wheel controls . The handbrake in the Stonic is manual. The electrochromic rearview mirror in the EX+ and a sunglasses case in the front overhead console lamp of both variants create convenience for the driver and the passengers alike. The black high gloss center fascia houses an 8-inch floating infotainment system . It supports both Apple CarPlay and Android Auto with voice recognition Bluetooth connectivity. The Bluetooth multi-connection allows two devices to be connected simultaneously, one for hands-free phone and media, the other for the media only. 6 powerful speakers in the Stonic stereo system provide a premium infotainment experience. There are also two charging ports , one in the fascia and the other for the rear passengers. The cruise control function, manual speed assist, and the push-button start/stop feature are only available in KIA Stonic EX+. The EX+ also comes with forward and reverse Park Assist Sensors. Both the models have Vehicle Stability Management which ensures maximum security by maintaining the stability and balance of the car. Hill Start Assist further improves the driving experience on steep roads. The Anti-Lock Braking system helps provide better handling on slippery paths. The modern feature of single-zone climate control also helps maintain the internal climate of the vehicle stable. Kia Stonic Engine Both the KIA Stonic EX and KIA Stonic EX+ come with a 1.4L petrol engine . The 6-speed automatic transmission engine generates 99 horsepower @ 6,000 rpm and 133 Nm @ 4,000 rpm to give optimum performance for these front-wheel drive vehicles. Kia Stonic Mileage Both the KIA Stonic EX and the EX+ have a fuel consumption of 12km/l in the city and 16km/l on the highway. Kia Stonic Ride & Handling The KIA Stonic 2024 provides a smooth riding experience with the help of its traction control system . The electronic brake distribution (EBD) makes the ride balanced. Even during turns, it remains upright and rides smoothly over bumps. The steering experience is not as spectacular as its competitors especially when it comes to front-end grip. On the other hand, the steering is well-weighted which helps in being in your lane on the highway. Both the variants also come with tire pressure monitoring system which alerts you when any of the tires has low air pressure. The availability of stability control system further makes the driving experience more comfortable. Stonic Maintenance As KIA Stonic 2024 will be locally assembled in Pakistan, its auto parts will be easily available in the market. Moreover, consumers will find it easier to get their cars inspected and serviced. Stonic Competitors Currently, KIA Stonic 2024 is facing strong competition from Honda BR-V and MG ZS in the Pakistani market. Honda BR-V ’s 1.5L i-VTEC engine and MG ZS’ 1.5L NSE engine challenges KIA Stonic’s 1.4 L MPI engine. The BR-V also has an edge due to its 7-seater passenger capacity and 6-speed automatic transmission. As both BR-V and Stonic fall in the same cost category, BR-V’s better torque and higher ground clearance supersede Stonic. On the other hand, MG ZS has a more powerful engine, power-packed features. It is also branded as Pakistan’s most affordable SUV currently in the market which creates tough competition for KIA Stonic.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,,Yes,Yes,,Yes,Yes,,Yes,,,,,Yes,Yes,Yes,,Yes,,,,,,,,Yes,Yes,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,,,,,,,,,,,

Th e first generation of the KIA Sportage was introduced in the early 2000s and was a relatively popular low-budget SUV in Pakistan. However, the second generation launched in 2006 was not a hit due to poor safety ratings and unappealing features. When KIA ended its joint venture with Dewan Mushtaq Group and left Pakistan, the second generation Sportage also left the market. The third generation of the Sportage was launched globally in 2010 , with better safety features and an improved body structure. The fourth generation KIA Sportage made a comeback in Pakistan in August 2019 , and since then, it has become a hot-selling SUV in the country. Although it has a history in Pakistan, it was reintroduced in two variants: All Wheel Drive (AWD) and Front Wheel Drive (FWD) . Later, in June 2020, KIA Pakistan added the Sportage Alpha as a third variant to the lineup. The fourth generation of the KIA Sportage has been a huge success in Pakistan. Kia Sportage 2024 Exterior The new 5th generation Sportage is true to its name, sporty and revolutionary in design. The signature KIA tiger nose grille looks wider and bolder. New boomerang-styled DRLs extend along the fender and hood line. Other new design elements include cube-styled headlights, dual spot fog lights, slim LED taillights, and rear blacked out bumper. Kia Sportage 2024 Interior The interior of the new KIA Sportage is high-tech and sophisticated . There is a new panoramic curved wide glass panel that hides two digital screens integrated together. One serves as the driver instrumental panel behind the steering wheel, while the other works as the infotainment system. There is a new and minimalistic slim HVAC climate control panel. A new steering wheel with a new brand logo and control buttons, three-dimensional air vents, and central console give the interior a modern look. Sportage 2024 Engine KIA Sportage 2024 is available in different engine options across different international markets. Two engine sizes are most likely to make their way to the Pakistani market. One is a 2.4L 4-cylinder engine with 181 hp and 240 Nm of torque. The other is a 1.6L turbocharged gasoline engine with 177 hp, 265 Nm of torque, and 7-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. Sportage Mileage The combined city/highway fuel economy figure for the 5th generation Sportage is 11 kilometers per litre. It has a wide fuel tank capacity 62 Litres.

It was available in 5-seater and 7-seater options. It also came with options regarding transmission with 6-speed automatic and 6-speed manual transmission.

The first-generation Hyundai Sonata was introduced in 1985 as a successor of Hyundai Stellar. The consumer response for the first generation was so poor that the company had to pull it out of the market. The second-generation Sonata was a step-up and was launched in 1988. This generation was not only sold locally but was also sold in Canada, North America, and Europe. The car was received positively in the market and came with Mitsubishi’s engine. It later received a mid-term facelift in 1999. The third-generation Sonata was introduced in 1993 with a 2.0 liters engine. It was sold as Sonata in South Korea and as Marcia internationally with some modifications to the exterior. The third-generation Sonata received a facelift in 1996 with modification to the front and rear as well as to the engine. The fourth-generation Hyundai Sonata was launched in 1998 and came with  the Hyundai-Kia Y4 platform. It became larger in size but had the same wheelbase. In 2001, the Fourth-generation Sonata received a facelift that included modifications to bonnet, grille, headlights, tail-lights and rear license plate location from the fascia to the trunk lid. It was sold internationally and can still be seen in South Korea. The fifth-generation Sonata was launched in 2004 in Korea and came with 2 engine options. It was launched in the U.S. in 2005 with standard safety features. In 2008, the facelifted Sonata was launched. Among the changes were redesigned engines, a new front fascia, chrome 3-bar grille, taillights, jewel-projector headlights, 10-spoke alloy wheels, and an extensively revised Instrument Panel. The sixth-generation Sonata debuted in 2009 and remained in production till 2014 with the advent of the seventh generation. The sixth-generation received a facelift in 2012 which featured several upgrades to the exterior as well as interior. Later in 2014, the seventh generation Sonata was launched. It received a facelift in 2017 and was named “Sonata New Rise” in South Korea with radical redesign. It also featured the Plug-in Hybrid variant of Sonata. The eighth-generation Sonata was launched in 2019 in South Korea. It features a sporty design and advanced features. The eighth generation Sonata is available in two variants in Pakistan - Hyundai Sonata 2.0 and Hyundai Sonata 2.5 . Hyundai Sonata Exterior The new Hyundai Sonata 8th generation 2024 is known for its unique and futuristic design language. Termed as “ Sensuous Sportiness ” by Hyundai, the new Sonata features a fastback-like shape. The front of the car sports a sleek narrow grille that is accompanied by LED projection headlamps which run along the length of the bonnet. The front also houses LED daytime running lights (DRLs) and front parking sensors . The rear of the car has C-shaped horizontal LED rear combination tail lights which connect with each other along the width of the car, giving Sonata 2024 a modern and futuristic look. The car comes with 18-inch alloy wheels and the sides of the car sport electrically adjustable and retractable side mirrors which have LED turn signals. The roof has a panoramic sunroof and a shark fin antenna. Hyundai Sonata Interior The Sonata 2024 has a luxurious two-toned camel colored leather interior. The front seats have adjustable headrests and lumbar support. The driver’s seat is power adjustable and provides premium comfort. The rear seats also come with adjustable headrests and armrests with cup holders. The rear seats also feature the 60/40 split function to increase boot space. Rear seats also have a rear USB charging port and leather foamed seat corners. The 4-spoke leather wrapped steering wheel is electronically powered and has tilt and telescope adjustment features. The steering wheel sports steering wheel switches for Audio, MID, Voice Control, and Cruise Control. Behind the steering wheel is a 12.3-inch high resolution TFT LCD that displays necessary vehicle information. The Hyundai Sonata 2.5 2024 also has head up display and SuperVision gauge cluster as premium features. The center fascia houses an 8-inch floating infotainment screen which supports AM/FM radio, MP3, as well as USB and AUX connectivity. The car also has a rearview camera for visual access to the rear environment of the car. Automatic dual zone climate control , auto defogger, and rear AC ventilation are standard features in Sonata 2024. Anti-lock Braking System (ABS), electronic brake-force distribution, and brake assist are standard brake features in the car. Sonata 2024 also has Auto Brake Hold and Electronic Parking Brake (EPB) for safer and more convenient parking. The car also supports automatic tailgate with remote boot lid feature. Sonata Safety The new Sonata 2024 supports central door locking, speed sensing door lock , and child safety lock. It supports keyless entry with a smart key, has an immobilizer and a burglar alarm.

Hyundai Sonata Engine Hyundai Sonata comes in two engine options: Hyundai Sonata 2.0 and Hyundai Sonata 2.5. Hyundai Sonata 2.0 which has a 2000cc naturally aspirated engine that generates a maximum power of 152/6200 Hp/Rpm at a maximum torque of 192/4500 Nm/Rpm. The Hyundai Sonata 2.5 comes with a 2500cc naturally aspirated engine , which generates a maximum power of 180/6000 Hp/Rpm at a maximum torque of 232/4000 Nm/Rpm. Both the variants are 2WD with 6-Speed Automatic Transmission. Sonata Ride & Handling The 2WD Hyundai Sonata 2024 prioritizes comfort over sportiness. Although the car looks sporty from the outside, its engine is designed to provide a comfortable and smooth ride rather than a fast one. Its handling is composed and its suspension absorbs most of the shocks in the road. The overall ride quality of the Sonata is good. Sonata Maintenance The maintenance of Hyundai Sonata 2024 is easy but as the car has been recently launched, its auto parts are not easily available in the market . Sonata Competitors Sonata is Pakistan’s first locally assembled D-segment sedan, so it does not have any direct competition. However, the car will hit the sales of two other imported D-segment sedans, the Honda Accord and Toyota Camry . Honda Accord shares almost all the features with the Hyundai Sonata and is also larger in dimensions than Sonata.

MG HS Exterior The MG HS 2024 showcases a striking and contemporary exterior design with distinctive styling elements. At the front, the prominent stardust grille, adorned with the MG logo, takes center stage, giving the car a commanding presence. The front fascia is enhanced by sleek LED headlamps with manual leveling, LED daytime running lights (DRLs), fog lamps, and convenient auto-lighting and follow me home features. Moving to the rear, the MG HS 2024 boasts a purposeful spoiler with an integrated high-mounted brake light, along with LED taillamps that provide eye-catching sequent illumination. The car is equipped with electrically adjustable side mirrors, featuring heating functionality and integrated LED side indicators for added convenience and safety. The wipers of the MG HS are boneless and include rain sensors, ensuring optimal visibility during inclement weather conditions. Noteworthy features of the MG HS include welcome lights that illuminate the surroundings upon approach and a sleek shark fin antenna that adds a touch of modernity. Furthermore, the car is equipped with a panoramic sunroof on the top, allowing natural light to fill the cabin, and a power tailgate for easy access to the cargo area. MG HS Interior The MG HS 2024 offers three interior color options: black, red, and beige , with comfortable polyurethane and PVC wrapped seats. The MG HS 2024 offers a range of convenient and advanced features for both driver and passenger comfort. Keyless entry with a smart key allows for easy access and starting of the vehicle. The driver's seat provides manual lumbar adjustment and can be adjusted in six different ways, while the front passenger seat offers four-way adjustment. Adding to the comfort, the front center armrest is slidable and includes a coolbox and storage compartments. The rear seats are angle adjustable and can be split 40/60 to create additional boot space. A rear armrest with a cupholder is also provided for passenger convenience. Inside the MG HS, dual-zone climate control ensures personalized temperature settings, while rear AC vents help maintain a comfortable environment for all occupants. Electric air conditioning control is available as an optional feature. The car features a center storage box with cooling, and various compartments such as the sun visors, rearview mirrors, and glove box are illuminated for easy access in low-light conditions. Ambient lighting adds a touch of elegance to the interior. The speed-sensitive power steering wheel incorporates a visually appealing instrument panel in the background, providing essential information to the driver. The car is equipped with a 10.1-inch infotainment display that supports features such as color radio, a navigation system, Bluetooth connectivity, and smartphone integration. It also provides information from the rear parking distance sensors, assisting in safe maneuvering. Safety is a top priority in the MG HS 2024. The car includes driver and passenger seatbelt reminders, a rear row seatbelt reminder, child lock functionality, Isofix attachment points for child seats, and six airbags for occupant protection. An alarm system adds an additional layer of security. One of the standout safety features of the MG HS is the MG Pilot, which comprises a suite of driver-assist technologies. These features include adaptive cruise control, automatic emergency braking, an intelligent speed assist system, lane departure warning, traffic jam assist, intelligent cruise assist, front collision warning, a blind spot detection system, lane change assist, and rear cross-traffic alert. These advanced technologies enhance driver confidence and safety on the road. HS Engine The SUV comes with a 1.5L GDI turbo-charged engine that produces 160hp with maximum 250Nm torque. MG HS Ride & Handling The MG HS offers a generally smooth and comfortable ride, ensuring a pleasant driving experience for passengers. The suspension system plays a vital role in maintaining a smooth ride by effectively absorbing shocks and minimizing road vibrations. This helps to provide a soft and cushioned feel, enhancing overall comfort. However, it is worth noting that at higher speeds, the MG HS can become somewhat noisy and the ride may feel slightly rough. This is a consideration for those who frequently travel at high speeds or prefer a quieter cabin environment. In terms of performance, the car's gearbox is responsive, allowing for smooth gear changes. However, compared to some competitors, the gearbox may not be as quick in terms of shifting speeds. This means that while the MG HS provides a comfortable ride, it may not deliver the same level of agility or immediate response as some other vehicles in its class. Overall, the MG HS 2024 strikes a balance between comfort and performance, delivering a generally smooth ride with its effective suspension system. While it may not be the quickest in terms of gear shifting, it provides a comfortable and enjoyable driving experience for daily commutes and longer journeys. MG HS Maintenance Maintenance of MG HS is easy if all you need is an oil change or other regular maintenance services. But, consumers will have to wait for other auto parts of the car for a considerable amount of time as they are not available in Pakistan. HS Competitors The MG HS competes with notable rivals such as the Proton X70, Kia Sportage, Hyundai Tucson, and Glory 580 Pro. The MG HS offers advantages in the form of a panoramic sunroof and advanced safety features, providing an enhanced driving experience. On the other hand, the competitors have their own strengths. The Proton X70, Kia Sportage, and Hyundai Tucson feature larger fuel tanks and dimensions, as well as more powerful engines, offering a sense of power and capability on the road. The Proton X70 also shares the advantage of a panoramic sunroof and safety features with the MG HS. The Kia Sportage stands out with its powerful engine, larger fuel tank, and more affordable price point, although it is comparatively smaller in size.

This helps to provide a soft and cushioned feel, enhancing overall comfort. However, it is worth noting that at higher speeds, the MG HS can become somewhat noisy and the ride may feel slightly rough. This is a consideration for those who frequently travel at high speeds or prefer a quieter cabin environment. In terms of performance, the car's gearbox is responsive, allowing for smooth gear changes. However, compared to some competitors, the gearbox may not be as quick in terms of shifting speeds. This means that while the MG HS provides a comfortable ride, it may not deliver the same level of agility or immediate response as some other vehicles in its class. Overall, the MG HS 2024 strikes a balance between comfort and performance, delivering a generally smooth ride with its effective suspension system. While it may not be the quickest in terms of gear shifting, it provides a comfortable and enjoyable driving experience for daily commutes and longer journeys.

But, consumers will have to wait for other auto parts of the car for a considerable amount of time as they are not available in Pakistan.

The MG HS offers advantages in the form of a panoramic sunroof and advanced safety features, providing an enhanced driving experience. On the other hand, the competitors have their own strengths.

The front grille is quite prominent, it is also called Galaxy Grille, and it has MG badging in its center. The car’s charging doc is under this very logo, which you can open by pressing it. Furthermore, the front bumper has a diffuser with air vents, which play an essential role in the ZS EV ’s aerodynamics. These vents are also very helpful in keeping the electric motor cool. Moreover, the bumper has both upper and lower lip, which have metallic colored outlines. The shape of front lamps is inspired by the London Eye , while it also has DRLs. The car has a quite bulky front look, mainly due to grille and headlights. Coming to the side, the first thing you will notice is its 17-inch alloy wheels, as their shape is like Dutch Windmills. Furthermore, it has Michelin tyres. The car’s side has two grey colored lines, one on top and one in the lower part, from front to back. Meanwhile, the door handles are chromed, and s ide-view mirrors are body-coloured. The rear of the car is gorgeous as it has Lava LEDs, inspired by Northern Star. The ZS EV SUV also has Shark Fin Antenna , High Mounted Brake Lamp, Spoiler, Rear Wiper and MG badging. You will also see Parking Sensors , a beautiful black rear bumper and diffuser. Boot Capacity: The car doesn’t have the autoboot feature ; instead, you can open it by pressing MG logo at the rear. The car has a decent boot capacity, as you can put 2-3 large-size luggage bags in it. You can increase the boot capacity by folding rear seats. Furthermore, the trunk has an Emergency Kit and Home Charger. Interior: The MG ZS EV 2024 has feature of keyless entry , so, you can open the car with one push of a button. The front and back seats have very good entry/exit space, along with ample leg and headspace . Furthermore, the driving seat is electric, and you can adjust it as per your choice. Two adults and one minor can sit very easily for a short journey on rear seats, while two passengers can sit easily for more extended travel. The company has also installed Seat Belts on backseats, along with Child ISOFIX seat option. Moreover, the whole interior is designed with Dark and Light Grey color tones. Steering Wheel & Dashboard: The steering wheel has a very chic opaque design , which compliments the whole interior. It has steering controls on the left and right side. From buttons on the left side, you can control audio and its source, while from the ride side, you can navigate the TFT in the speedometer. The dashboard of the car is made of leatherette fabric, with a hand stitching pattern. The overall quality of the dashboard is excellent, except for Glove Box’s material. Speedometer: You can switch on the car with Push Start Button, and its speedometer will show all basic information and warning lights right at the start. You will see a ‘Ready’ sign in the center of the meter when it will be ready to drive. On left side, it has Analogue Speed , while in its lower left side, it has Charging Voltage Information. Meanwhile, on the right side, it has Charging Status replacing the Fuel Status on petrol/diesel cars. Furthermore, the meter will show the usage of electric power. Meanwhile, the central TFT gives you shows you the Charging Range, Digital Speedometer, Energy Flow, Tyre Pressure Monitor, Current Trip Information, Mileage, and other overall consumption. Infotainment System: The MG ZS EV has an 8-inch touchscreen , which has Apple CarPlay and Android AutoPlay. You can also navigate it through your steering controls. Furthermore, you can control Speed, Car, and Audio Settings from the screen. The car has Conventional AC System , while AC and Audio Knobs are well designed and give a very traditional look. The AC vents and Door Controls are seemed to be inspired by Audio design. Central Console: The Gear Knob is quite unconventional, and seemed to be inspired by Jaguar. You can rotate the knob to set it on different options, i.e., Drive, Reverse or Neutral. Furthermore, it has Dynamic Rear Camera , which will move with your car. Meanwhile, you can put the car in Park, by pressing the Gear Knob. Furthermore, it has Mode, KERS and Battery buttons. Under the Gear Knob, you will find Electronic Handbrake and Auto Hold buttons. The console also has Cup Holders, Central Armrest and Storage Space under the Armrest. The lower part of the console has 12V Cigarette Lighter and 2 USB ports and small storage space. Panoramic Sunroof: You can open the cover of Sunroof with a button push in the car’s roof. To open the Sunroof, MG has installed a very conventional rotating button . You can select different levels of opening through this button. The Sunroof also has a net protection in the front, which will keep you safe from any small pebbles. Drive: This car’s most exciting feature is its driving experience, as it has 44.5Kw electric motor , producing 147hp and 350Nm torque. The most crucial aspect of its drive is the car’s powe r, which you feel right after the first acceleration. The EV has an excellent push, and it speeds up very silently and instantly. The car owner has to drive it very carefully and must adapt himself to its power because it does look like other cars, but it is totally different in power and acceleration. Furthermore, you have to drive it with responsibility because it approaches individuals/traffic, crossing the road, faster than other cars, leading to accidents. So, you have to adjust yourself with its power and acceleration. Lastly, standard fuel cars produce engine noise , which gives an idea about the car’s speed, but this car is totally silent, and sometimes the driver would remain unable to calculate its speed. So, again, responsibility is most important while driving this electric vehicle. 0-100: The car reaches from 0 to 100 in 8.37 seconds. Driving Modes: The car has 3 Driving Modes, i.e., Eco, Sports and Normal Mode. You can select the modes from the Mode button on Central Console; the Sports Mode is most powerful. Furthermore, it has a KERS (Kinetic Energy Recovery System) button. This is another vital feature of ZS EV.  In normal cars, the speed reduces gradually after you leave the acceleration; however, ZS EV’s speed will get instantly low, after you lift the foot from the accelerator, which can cause an accident. The KERS also has three modes , i.e., Light, Moderate and Extreme. The third mode is the crucial one because it slows down the car very quickly, and vehicles behind you can crash into you. Charging and its Cost: You can charge this car at home as well as commercially. On commercial charging stations, you can charge this car fully in 1 hour 15 minutes. Meanwhile, a single charge will cost you around Rs950-1,000. On the other hand, it will cost you around Rs500-600 in a home charge , but it will take around 9-10 hours for a single charge. Another important thing you should notice is the charging time. If charging is quick from 0-80%, it means, the car has an excellent electric motor and batteries. The 0-80% charging time for ZS EV is under 40-minute, which is fantastic. Charging Range: You can drive this car up to 340-kilometer in single full charge. However, it varies on your driving style, like which features are you using, or which devices like AC are on, etc. If you drive this car with AC and full throttle , its range is between 250-340 kilometers. Hence, its per kilometer cost is Rs2-4, which is way too cheaper than petrol or diesel cars. Maintenance: MG ZS EV 2024 has zero maintenance cost because it has no Mobil oil or filter change . You only have to maintain its brake pads, which will cost you around Rs14-15,000, which is reasonable. Furthermore, the company is giving the 8-year battery and 100,000-kilometer/4-year comprehensive warranty. In short, it is a maintenance-free car because you don’t have to take it to workshops, except regular checkups. Range Anxiety: Like mobile phones, you would also have a charging range anxiety in this electric vehicle . When the battery starts giving ‘critical’ status, your mind would only focus on recharging the car, although it would still have a range of 50-70 kilometers. This is the gravest issue that EVs face in Pakistan because there are not many charging stations in the country. There is only one charging station in Lahore, and 2 in Islamabad. The government, who is advocating EV policy for the last two years, need to speed up its work. More and more charging stations need to be established across the country because it is fundamental for making EVs a success in Pakistan . Due to unavailability of charging stations on highways and motorways, this car is only for intracity travel. Another interesting point is that the mileage of this car on highways would be less than its intracity range. It is because, more you use the electric motor, more its range reduces. Stability: Due to the heavy weight of batteries , the car has excellent road grip and stability. Even on potholes, the car gives a robust response. Ground Clearance: The car has excellent ground clearance, and you can drive it easily over speed breakers and potholes on Pakistani roads. Cabin Noise: The cabin noise in this car is very minimal, as it is a very quiet machine. You will not hear much of traffic noise while sitting inside ZS EV, which is a great feature. Safety: The car has 6 airbags, making it a very safe vehicle to travel because local car manufacturers have ignored this feature for a long time.

Its front houses a butterfly grille which gives it a wider exposed area to increase per second intake and heat transfer. The car has dual waist design which, according to the company, provides aerodynamic streamline motion and reduces fuel consumption as a result.

Alsvin Mileage Changan Alsvin has an impressive mileage of 12 to 15 km/l on average. It has 12 km/l fuel economy within the city and 15-16 km/l on the highway. Alsvin Maintenance As Changan is a new company in Pakistan, it is difficult to find auto parts for Alsvin. Therefore, maintenance of Alsvin is not relatively easy. Alsvin Ride & Handling The new Changan Alsvin offers several features to enhance the driving experience. It is equipped with an Anti-lock braking system (ABS) that ensures safe and controlled braking, reducing the risk of skidding. Additionally, the car comes with cruise control, allowing the driver to maintain a steady speed on long journeys, contributing to a smooth and comfortable ride.The Alsvin has a wheelbase of 2535 mm, providing a stable foundation for the vehicle. This helps to reduce body roll and enhance overall stability, especially during cornering or maneuvers. Moreover, with a ground clearance of 151 mm, the Alsvin offers sufficient height to navigate uneven surfaces and speed breakers without scraping the undercarriage.Inside the car, the Changan Alsvin offers a comfortable and luxurious interior. The seats are designed to provide ample support and comfort, ensuring a pleasant experience for both the driver and passengers. The car is equipped with modern features that add convenience and style to the ride. Whether driving through the city with its potholes or cruising on the highway at high speeds, the Alsvin's interior helps to absorb shocks and vibrations, creating a smooth and enjoyable journey. Changan Alsvin Competitors Changan Alsvin competes with Toyota Yaris, Honda City, and KIA Picanto in the Pakistani market. Toyota Yaris is a strong competitor for Alsvin as it lies in the same price range and has similar features. Toyota also has a loyal consumer base in Pakistan which makes it difficult for new cars to sell easily. Alsvin beats Yaris when it comes to modern features such as steering switches, climate control, rear camera, rear speakers, etc., but it lacks traction control which is available in Yaris.

As the 4th largest automotive group in China, Changan's entry into the Pakistani market is a significant development for the country's automobile industry. Alsvin Exterior The exterior of the new Alsvin sets it apart from its competitors. Its front houses a butterfly grille which gives it a wider exposed area to increase per second intake and heat transfer. The car has dual waist design which, according to the company, provides aerodynamic streamline motion and reduces fuel consumption as a result. The grille is accompanied by dual-beam halogen projection headlamps which can be adjusted electrically from within the car. On top of that, Alsvin comes with LED curve daytime running lamps (DRLs) which are configurable. The tail lamps are two-part combination lamps with reverse lamp and fog lights. Changan Alsvin has a piano black shark fin antenna for better reception. The Lumiere variant also has an electric sunroof to allow more light into the car.

Alsvin Mileage Changan Alsvin has an impressive mileage of 12 to 15 km/l on average. It has 12 km/l fuel economy within the city and 15-16 km/l on the highway. Alsvin Maintenance As Changan is a new company in Pakistan, it is difficult to find auto parts for Alsvin. Therefore, maintenance of Alsvin is not relatively easy. Alsvin Ride & Handling The new Changan Alsvin offers several features to enhance the driving experience. It is equipped with an Anti-lock braking system (ABS) that ensures safe and controlled braking, reducing the risk of skidding. Additionally, the car comes with cruise control, allowing the driver to maintain a steady speed on long journeys, contributing to a smooth and comfortable ride.The Alsvin has a wheelbase of 2535 mm, providing a stable foundation for the vehicle.

Changan Alsvin Competitors Changan Alsvin competes with Toyota Yaris, Honda City, and KIA Picanto in the Pakistani market.

Alsvin beats Yaris when it comes to modern features such as steering switches, climate control, rear camera, rear speakers, etc., but it lacks traction control which is available in Yaris. Yaris also has a better build quality which adds to its value.

This includes the latest all-electric sedans E-Tron GT and RS E-Tron GT introduced by Audi in the Pakistani market. The E-Tron series aims to provide a fast, sports car-like experience while keeping the environment clean. The E-Tron GT has been launched worldwide to compete with Tesla Model S and Porsche Taycan. Audi e-tron GT Exterior The new Audi E-Tron GT quattro and Audi RS e-tron GT 2024 both share a new, smart and sleek design. Audi's head of design Marc Lichte claims it is the most beautiful design he’s ever penned. The design is very similar to that of Audi’s A7 minus the front grille. The four-ringed emblem sits on a plastic plinth on the front. The front also sports the matrix LED headlamps with Audi laser light, dynamic lighting scheme, and dynamic turn signal. The back of the cars sports infinite LED rear combination lamps with dynamic lighting scheme and dynamic turn signal which make the cars stand out in a crowd. The design is aerodynamic for reaching maximum speeds. On top of that, intelligent air inlets are situated at the front. The vented wheel arches and the striking rear diffuser contribute further to the beauty and practicality of the design. The exterior mirrors are power-adjustable, heated with power-folding and auto-dimming on both sides along with the memory feature. Both the variants have a panoramic sunroof for better light. The Audi E-Tron GT quattro has 19-inch alloy wheels while the Audi RS e-tron GT has 20-inch alloy wheels. Both have 5-double-spoke offset style, Black, diamond-turned wheels. Audi e-tron GT Interior The interior of both Audi E-Tron GT quattro and RS e-tron GT also contributes to the environment-friendly feature as they come with an option of going leather-free and instead opt for resource-efficient materials for the whole interior. It has a 4 person seating capacity with an option of 5 seats which is a bit impractical given the small size of the seat. The legroom for the rear passengers is abundant but the headspace is a bit insufficient. The angular dashboard houses multiple digital displays one of which is the instrument panel and the other is a media display. It contains all the luxury infotainment features which are a signature of Audi. The central multimedia display is of 10.1 inches and can be operated by steering wheel switches as well as voice recognition software. Both of the variants come with a subscription-based Wi-Fi hotspot, wireless charging, and 16 speaker audio system. Other luxury features include ambient interior lighting, a head-up display, and heated-and-cooled power front seats with a memory feature for the driver’s seat. An auto-dimming interior rearview mirror adorns the interior. D-shaped leather-wrapped steering wheel comes with electric steering wheel adjustment and cup holders for all passengers are standard features. The interior focuses not only on aesthetics but also on function. Both the Audi E-Tron GT quattro and RS e-tron GT 2024 are loaded with driver-assistance features for a safe and comfortable ride. This includes adaptive cruise control, standard forward-collision warning, and automated emergency braking, along with the available options of blind-spot monitoring and rear cross-traffic alert as well as lane-departure warning and lane-keeping assist. Another modern feature includes remote self-parking assist, which allows the driver to park the car via a smartphone app. They also come with parking aid Plus with 360° display. Another feature is the comfort key with sensor-controlled luggage compartment release without SAFELOCK. Audi e-tron GT Engine The all-wheel-drive Audi quattro and RS e-tron GT have powerful dual motors with two-speed automatic transmission. The E-Tron GT comes with lithium-ion batteries which contain 93.4 kWh but available energy is 83.7kWh at a torque of 630 Nm. On the other hand, RS e-tron GT comes with a lithium-ion battery which generates the energy of 93.4 kWh at 830 Nm. The Front motor on both models is the same as 175kWh [235hp], while the rear motor on GT is 320kW [420hp] while that on RS e-tron GT is 335kW [450hp]. According to Audi, bot variants require only 22 minutes to get charged completely. It requires household plug type G (UK) for the compact e-tron charging system. Audi e-tron GT Mileage The Audi E-Tron GT quattro runs 21.6 kWh/100 km in the city and 19.9 kWh/100 km on the highway on full charging while the RS e-tron GT runs 22.5 kWh/100 km around town and 20.6 kWh/100 km on the highway. The Audi quattro reaches a top speed of 245 km/h while the RS e-tron GT variant reaches 250km/h. On top of that, the E-Tron GT reaches from zero to 100 kilometers in 4.5 seconds while the RS e-tron GT variant takes only 3.6 seconds. The speed is limited in both variants. Audi e-tron GT Colors Colors available for Audi E-Tron GT and RS E-Tron GT are as follows: Kemora Gray Mythos Black Metallic Suzuka Gray Metallic Tango Red Metallic Audi e-tron GT Ride & Handling Audi has paid special attention to the cars’ performance and it shows. The Audi E-Tron GT quattro runs smoothly on all kinds of roads and is easy to handle even at maximum speed. The RS e-tron GT is the sportier version that is quick and agile. Without producing any noise, the RS e-tron GT cruises smoothly and efficiently through curvy paths without any difficulty in handling. The rear motor on each variant deploys a 2-speed transmission for efficiency and performance. The Audi E-Tron GT quattro remains in second gear as much as possible for greater range. The RS e-tron GT, on the other hand, is for performance and launch purposes. In sport mode, the vehicle remains in first gear till 100km/h speed is achieved. Audi e-tron GT Maintenance As both the variants are electric vehicles, neither transmission and engine fluids nor any petrol is required for their running and maintenance. On top of that, it does not require any filter replacement either. Due to these factors, it is a low maintenance vehicle. Audi e-tron GT Competitors Audi Audi E-Tron GT quattro and RS e-tron GT have no competitors in the Pakistani market as yet. In the international market, it competes with Tesla Model S and Porsche Taycan. Porsche Taycan is strong competition for the GT variants because they all are based on the J1 Performance Platform which was developed by Porsche for the Taycan. This means that the GT variants and Taycan both are running on the same platform and the only difference is in the exterior. Porsche Taycan gives strong competition to the GT variants as it is a lot cheaper than Audi. Tesla Model S competes with Audi E-Tron GT quattro and RS e-tron GT in terms of driving range. Although the Audi variants can go 488 kilometers on a single charge, Tesla provides even more mileage. The Model S also comes with more interior space but it cannot compete with the GT variants due to their outstanding performance.

This includes the latest all-electric sedans E-Tron GT and RS E-Tron GT introduced by Audi in the Pakistani market. The E-Tron series aims to provide a fast, sports car-like experience while keeping the environment clean. The E-Tron GT has been launched worldwide to compete with Tesla Model S and Porsche Taycan. Audi e-tron GT Exterior The new Audi E-Tron GT quattro and Audi RS e-tron GT 2024 both share a new, smart and sleek design. Audi's head of design Marc Lichte claims it is the most beautiful design he’s ever penned. The design is very similar to that of Audi’s A7 minus the front grille. The four-ringed emblem sits on a plastic plinth on the front. The front also sports the matrix LED headlamps with Audi laser light, dynamic lighting scheme, and dynamic turn signal. The back of the cars sports infinite LED rear combination lamps with dynamic lighting scheme and dynamic turn signal which make the cars stand out in a crowd. The design is aerodynamic for reaching maximum speeds. On top of that, intelligent air inlets are situated at the front. The vented wheel arches and the striking rear diffuser contribute further to the beauty and practicality of the design. The exterior mirrors are power-adjustable, heated with power-folding and auto-dimming on both sides along with the memory feature. Both the variants have a panoramic sunroof for better light. The Audi E-Tron GT quattro has 19-inch alloy wheels while the Audi RS e-tron GT has 20-inch alloy wheels. Both have 5-double-spoke offset style, Black, diamond-turned wheels. Audi e-tron GT Interior The interior of both Audi E-Tron GT quattro and RS e-tron GT also contributes to the environment-friendly feature as they come with an option of going leather-free and instead opt for resource-efficient materials for the whole interior. It has a 4 person seating capacity with an option of 5 seats which is a bit impractical given the small size of the seat. The legroom for the rear passengers is abundant but the headspace is a bit insufficient. The angular dashboard houses multiple digital displays one of which is the instrument panel and the other is a media display. It contains all the luxury infotainment features which are a signature of Audi. The central multimedia display is of 10.1 inches and can be operated by steering wheel switches as well as voice recognition software. Both of the variants come with a subscription-based Wi-Fi hotspot, wireless charging, and 16 speaker audio system. Other luxury features include ambient interior lighting, a head-up display, and heated-and-cooled power front seats with a memory feature for the driver’s seat. An auto-dimming interior rearview mirror adorns the interior. D-shaped leather-wrapped steering wheel comes with electric steering wheel adjustment and cup holders for all passengers are standard features. The interior focuses not only on aesthetics but also on function. Both the Audi E-Tron GT quattro and RS e-tron GT 2024 are loaded with driver-assistance features for a safe and comfortable ride. This includes adaptive cruise control, standard forward-collision warning, and automated emergency braking, along with the available options of blind-spot monitoring and rear cross-traffic alert as well as lane-departure warning and lane-keeping assist. Another modern feature includes remote self-parking assist, which allows the driver to park the car via a smartphone app. They also come with parking aid Plus with 360° display. Another feature is the comfort key with sensor-controlled luggage compartment release without SAFELOCK. Audi e-tron GT Engine The all-wheel-drive Audi quattro and RS e-tron GT have powerful dual motors with two-speed automatic transmission. The E-Tron GT comes with lithium-ion batteries which contain 93.4 kWh but available energy is 83.7kWh at a torque of 630 Nm. On the other hand, RS e-tron GT comes with a lithium-ion battery which generates the energy of 93.4 kWh at 830 Nm. The Front motor on both models is the same as 175kWh [235hp], while the rear motor on GT is 320kW [420hp] while that on RS e-tron GT is 335kW [450hp]. According to Audi, bot variants require only 22 minutes to get charged completely. It requires household plug type G (UK) for the compact e-tron charging system. Audi e-tron GT Mileage The Audi E-Tron GT quattro runs 21.6 kWh/100 km in the city and 19.9 kWh/100 km on the highway on full charging while the RS e-tron GT runs 22.5 kWh/100 km around town and 20.6 kWh/100 km on the highway. The Audi quattro reaches a top speed of 245 km/h while the RS e-tron GT variant reaches 250km/h. On top of that, the E-Tron GT reaches from zero to 100 kilometers in 4.5 seconds while the RS e-tron GT variant takes only 3.6 seconds. The speed is limited in both variants. Audi e-tron GT Colors Colors available for Audi E-Tron GT and RS E-Tron GT are as follows: Kemora Gray Mythos Black Metallic Suzuka Gray Metallic Tango Red Metallic Audi e-tron GT Ride & Handling Audi has paid special attention to the cars’ performance and it shows. The Audi E-Tron GT quattro runs smoothly on all kinds of roads and is easy to handle even at maximum speed. The RS e-tron GT is the sportier version that is quick and agile. Without producing any noise, the RS e-tron GT cruises smoothly and efficiently through curvy paths without any difficulty in handling. The rear motor on each variant deploys a 2-speed transmission for efficiency and performance. The Audi E-Tron GT quattro remains in second gear as much as possible for greater range. The RS e-tron GT, on the other hand, is for performance and launch purposes. In sport mode, the vehicle remains in first gear till 100km/h speed is achieved. Audi e-tron GT Maintenance As both the variants are electric vehicles, neither transmission and engine fluids nor any petrol is required for their running and maintenance. On top of that, it does not require any filter replacement either. Due to these factors, it is a low maintenance vehicle. Audi e-tron GT Competitors Audi Audi E-Tron GT quattro and RS e-tron GT have no competitors in the Pakistani market as yet. In the international market, it competes with Tesla Model S and Porsche Taycan. Porsche Taycan is strong competition for the GT variants because they all are based on the J1 Performance Platform which was developed by Porsche for the Taycan. This means that the GT variants and Taycan both are running on the same platform and the only difference is in the exterior. Porsche Taycan gives strong competition to the GT variants as it is a lot cheaper than Audi. Tesla Model S competes with Audi E-Tron GT quattro and RS e-tron GT in terms of driving range. Although the Audi variants can go 488 kilometers on a single charge, Tesla provides even more mileage. The Model S also comes with more interior space but it cannot compete with the GT variants due to their outstanding performance.

It was first launched in 1985 and became a major milestone in the Malaysian Automotive industry. It is one of the longest-running numberplates of Proton with more than a million units produced over 35 years. The first-generation Proton Saga 2024 was developed in collaboration with Mitsubishi Motors and was available in two variants. It became an instant hit and received awards and accolades for its design and performance. It was produced till 2008 and was exported around the world due to its high demand. In 2008, the second-generation Proton Saga was launched in three variants and received record bookings within two weeks of its launch. The third-generation Proton Saga was launched in 2016. The car featured an improved security system with electronic stability control and a 20% stronger body. It received a facelift in 2019 which featured an upgraded trim. The Proton Saga was launched in Pakistan in collaboration with the Al-Haj Group . The car has three variants - Proton Saga Standard MT, Proton Saga Standard AT, and Proton Saga Ace. Proton Saga Exterior The new Proton Saga 2024 comes with a smooth and attractive design that features curves and a round design language. The front of the car houses Proton’s signature “infinite weave grille ” which is coupled with a front bumper. Halogen headlamps are a standard feature in all the variants but the Ace variant also has LED daytime running lights (DRLs). The side of the car has electric side mirrors with LED turn signal lamps which make it unique among its competitors. The rear of the car is simple with a rear bumper and the Ace variant comes with a rear spoiler as well. Remote trunk release is another standard feature supported by all the variants of Proton Saga 2024. Proton Saga Interior The new proton Saga 2024 has a spacious and comfortable interior . The urethane-wrapped steering wheel comes with a tilt adjustment feature. The Ace variant also has steering switches for audio and telephone control. Behind the steering wheel is an LCD integrated meter combination with a multi-information display. All the variants of proton Saga sport ECO Drive Assist , power windows, keyless entry, a 12V power socket, and driver’s seat height adjuster. The Ace variant comes with some additional features such as a luggage lamp and 3 USB ports in the car. The infotainment system in the Standard AT and MT variants is a standard audio system with two speakers and Bluetooth connectivity. On the other hand, the Ace variant has a 7-inch floating touchscreen that supports Bluetooth and smartphone connectivity and has 4 speakers. Other common features in the Proton Saga 2024 include sun visor, map lamp, and bench-type rear seat fold. Saga Safety The new Proton Saga 2024 has several safety and security features such as front airbags, front seatbelts, immobilizer, anti-theft alarm , and parking sensors to name a few.

Proton Saga Ride & Handling Proton Saga 2024 is an easy-to-ride vehicle. The car shows impressive control at high speeds and its suspension absorbs most of the potholes and bumps on the road. A drawback of Proton is its slow responsiveness which makes its handling a bit difficult. Overall, the car provides a comfortable ride in exchange for the paid amount. Saga Maintenance The maintenance of Proton Saga is convenient as its auto parts are affordable and easy to find. Its 5-year warranty is also a huge plus. Saga Competitors In Pakistan, Proton Saga competes with Changan Alsvin, Honda City, and Toyota Yaris . Since its introduction in Pakistan over a decade ago, Honda City has been sold in massive numbers. However, its appeal has been fading because there is no new feature in this car, which is being sold at a considerably higher price than its competitors. Toyota Yaris was a new addition in the market last year which made the consumers excited for something new and was sold in large numbers. Both of these cars are a lot more expensive than the Proton Saga which makes Saga a more desirable choice.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,,Yes,Yes,Yes,,Yes,,Yes,Yes,Yes,,Yes,,Yes,Yes,,Yes,,Yes,Yes,,,,,,,,,Yes,,,Yes,Yes,,Yes,,,Yes,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,,,,,,,,Yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The company is the second-largest motorcycle manufacturer in Pakistan, which adds to the credibility of their car production. United Bravo is a rebadged version of the Dahe 350 and was launched after the discontinuation of Pakistan's favorite car, Suzuki Mehran. The car shares several features with Mehran, which includes its compact size and fuel efficiency. United Bravo Exterior The car’s overall look resembles the Volkswagen Golf. There is a sleek grille at the front with a United logo. Crystal front lights along with fog lamps, and 13-inch alloy wheels are other exterior highlights. 2018 Bravo had serious issues with back doors fitting and closing because of gaps in plastic. Although the company has improved the overall quality, you can still see uneven plastic parts in the car.Bravo’s rear profile looks beautiful with LED brake lights and fog lamps. The car also has high mounted brake lamps, shark fin antenna and parking sensors; all are great features for an 800cc hatchback. Initially, the company did not provide a spare tyre or a tool kit with the vehicle. The current model has both items with a compromised boot space. United Bravo Interior United Bravo’s interior is equipped with many advanced features. The dashboard looks basic with a wooden panel. It has a 7-inch LCD display with Bluetooth, AUX, SD card, and even back view camera with parking sensors. The speedometer is quite good with all basic information such as analogue rpm, digital speed meter, fuel average, trips and car heat, seat belt warning, and reverse light.The power steering has a grey color shade, which looks beautiful. The air conditioning system is manual and very basic. The centre console has cup holders, handbrake, and armrest with storage space. United Bravo Engine The United Bravo 2024 is equipped with a 796 cc in-line 3-cylinder engine. This compact engine configuration delivers a maximum power output of 40 horsepower at 5500 RPM and a maximum torque of 60 Nm at 3500 RPM. The engine is designed to provide sufficient power for urban commuting and everyday driving needs.The transmission system in the United Bravo is a 4-speed manual. The manual transmission allows for precise gear shifting and gives the driver full control over the vehicle's acceleration and gear selection. With the manual transmission, drivers can optimize the performance of the United Bravo according to their preferences and driving conditions.The combination of the 796 cc engine and the 4-speed manual transmission ensures a balance of power and fuel efficiency, making the United Bravo suitable for city driving and daily commuting. The compact engine size also contributes to the Bravo's overall agility and maneuverability on the road. United Bravo Mileage This budget car gives a fuel average of 15 to 16 kilometres per liter in the city, with 30 Litre fuel tank capacity. United Bravo Ride & Handling The United Bravo is known for its ease of riding and comfortable travel experience, especially for up to four passengers. The car's design provides ample space and comfort for its occupants, ensuring a pleasant journey.One of the advantages of the Bravo is its good ground clearance, which enables it to navigate through rough roads and tackle speed bumps without much difficulty. This feature makes it suitable for city driving, where road conditions can vary.However, one drawback of the United Bravo is its tendency to vibrate at high speeds. This vibration can be felt throughout the car and may cause discomfort for the passengers, especially during long highway journeys or when driving at higher speeds. It's important to note this aspect if considering the Bravo for long-distance travel.Additionally, the United Bravo is prone to body roll, which means it leans or sways more than desired during cornering or sharp turns. This characteristic can make it less ideal for driving on highways or twisty roads, where stability and maneuverability are crucial. United Bravo Maintenance The maintenance of United Bravo is easy. Its auto parts are easily available everywhere and are affordable . United Bravo Competition The Prince Pearl is a direct competitor to the United Bravo. It shares several features with the Bravo, including similar engine power, mileage, and interior features. The Pearl has been recently launched and is expected to have a comparable resale value to the Bravo.In comparison, the Suzuki Mehran, which has been discontinued in Pakistan, has been replaced by the Bravo. The Bravo offers additional features such as power windows, rear camera, keyless entry, and fog lights, making it a more attractive option for buyers seeking a budget-friendly vehicle with modern features.Another strong competitor to the United Bravo is the Suzuki Alto. The Alto offers better mileage and larger dimensions than the Bravo, making it a formidable rival in the same price range. The Alto's superior fuel efficiency and spaciousness give it an edge over the Bravo.",Yes,Yes,,,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,,,,,Yes,,,Yes,,Yes,Yes,,Yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,,,,,,,Yes,Yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unveiled on the 2nd of January, this will be Pakistan’s first car of 2021. Followed by the launch event in Lahore, locally assembled CKD units will go on sale in the local auto market. United Motors might also launch an automatic variant of the Alpha model in the near future. United Alpha 2024 has a history with Pakistan. In 2005, Chery Automobiles Co. of China entered the Pakistani market with their famous family car, the Chery QQ. The 800cc car had a reliable build quality and a lot of promising features. However, at that time, Suzuki Mehran and Daihatsu Cuore were the champions of local hatchbacks. So, this Chinese car could not compete with the Big 3 (Honda, Suzuki, and Toyota) and failed in the local market. This time, Chery QQ is making a comeback in Pakistan with a new name, new face, and a new strategy. One of the things that are different about the United Alpha launch is that United Motors is the sole owner and supplier of this car. Chery Automobiles Co. is no longer part of this debut. Feature Highlights United Alpha 2024 Pakistan will be launched with a lot of new features such as: 993cc 4-Cylinder Engine 5-Speed Manual Transmission Power Steering Power Windows 13-inch Alloy Wheels Engine Alpha has a 993cc 4-cylinder engine, capable of producing 69hp and 93Nm Torque paired with 5-speed manual transmission.
